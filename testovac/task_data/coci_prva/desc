<h1> Úloha: Krížovka </h1>

Little Ivica solves crossword puzzles every day. In case you haven't seen one, a crossword puzzle
starts
on a grid of R×C squares, each of which is either empty or blocked. The player's task is to write
words
in consecutive empty squares vertically (top down) or horizontally (left to right).
<br><br>Ivica's sister has a strange habit of looking at crosswords Ivica has finished solving, and finding
the
<b>lexicographically smallest word</b> in it. She only considers words at least 2 characters long.
<br><br>Write a program that, given a crossword puzzle, finds that word.

<br><br>The first line contains two integers R and C (2 ≤ R, C ≤ 20), the number of rows and columns
in the
crossword.
<br><br>Each of the following R lines contains a string of C characters. Each of those characters is either
a
lowercase letter of the English alphabet, or the character '#' representing a blocked square.
<br><br>The input will be such that a solution will always exist.
<br><br>Output the lexicographically smallest word in the crossword.
